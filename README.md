# 🚀 Sentiment Analysis Web App with Django 🚀

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis Web App**! This project demonstrates the power of machine learning by transforming a sentiment analysis model into a fully functional web application using **Django**. The web app allows users to input text and get immediate feedback on whether the sentiment is positive or negative. Additionally, the app features an **interactive sentiment meter** that visualizes the sentiment intensity, offering an engaging and user-friendly experience.

## 🎉 Features
- **Real-time Sentiment Prediction**: Get instant predictions of the sentiment (positive or negative) based on user-provided text.
- **Interactive Sentiment Meter**: Visualizes the sentiment intensity on a dynamic meter, giving immediate visual feedback.
- **Elegant UI/UX**: Designed with **Django**, the app provides a modern and intuitive interface for a seamless user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive web app that works across all devices, thanks to **Bootstrap**.

## 🔍 What’s New?
- **Advanced Sentiment Analysis Model**: Uses cutting-edge machine learning techniques to accurately predict sentiment from text.
- **Real-time Interactive Feedback**: Sentiment meter provides visual representation of sentiment, showing positive/negative intensity.
- **Django Backend**: Built with Django to ensure robust backend functionality and ease of deployment.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Django**: For backend development and handling of HTTP requests.
- **Python**: For implementing the sentiment analysis model and processing text.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and vectorization.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing (stopwords removal, tokenization).
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Optional, for deep learning models (if used).
- **HTML/CSS**: To create the web interface.
- **Bootstrap**: For a responsive and elegant UI design.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactions, such as the sentiment meter.

## 📊 How It Works:
1. **User Input**: The user types or pastes text into the input field.
2. **Prediction**: The text is sent to the backend, where it’s processed by the sentiment analysis model.
3. **Sentiment Display**: The result is displayed to the user as either **Positive** or **Negative** sentiment, with a sentiment intensity shown on the **sentiment meter**.

## 🌍 Why Django?
- **Rapid Development**: Django’s built-in tools and libraries help streamline the development process.
- **Security**: Django provides robust security features that protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability**: The framework is highly scalable, allowing the app to grow with more complex features in the future.
- **Integration with Machine Learning**: Django integrates seamlessly with machine learning models, allowing us to easily deploy them into the web app.

## 📝 Demo and Screenshots

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anurag-raj03/Sentiment-Analysis-Web-App.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis-Web-App
````

### 2. Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.8+).

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

## 🚀 How to Use:

1. Open the web app in your browser.
2. Type or paste any text (e.g., a product review or social media post).
3. Click on **Predict Sentiment** to get the sentiment prediction (positive/negative).
4. The sentiment intensity will be displayed dynamically on the sentiment meter.
